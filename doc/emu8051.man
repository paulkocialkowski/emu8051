.B emu8051
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILENAME\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBemu8051\fR is a simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers. It is available in two versions: a console (text-only) version and a graphical version (using the GTK+ toolkit). This is an Open-Source project. The program can load Intel HEX files.

Once loaded, a program can be run (it will run indefinitely or until a breakpoint is encountered). You can also use the STEP button to execute only a single instruction at a time and see the effects on registers and memory.

It is written in C++, and uses Perl scripts to generate automatically C++ functions corresponding to each assembly instruction of the 8051 microcontroller.
