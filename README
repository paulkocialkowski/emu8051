                  Emu8051

Emu8051 is a simulator/emulator for the Intel 8051 family of microcontrollers.
It is available in two versions: a console (text-only) version and a graphical
version (using the GTK+ toolkit). This is an Open-Source project. The program
can load Intel HEX files. Once loaded, a program can be run (it will run
indefinitely or until a breakpoint is encountered). You can also use the STEP
button to execute only a single instruction at a time and see the effects on
registers and memory. It is written in C, and uses Perl scripts to generate
automatically C functions corresponding to each assembly instruction of the
8051 microcontroller.

Installation:

  For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.


Regression testing:

  Emu8051 now supports automatic regression tests. This feature is mainly for
  developers who want to make sure that whatever features they implement or
  whatever bug they fix don't create additional or new problems.

  To support that feature, you must have a compatible 8051 assembler installed.
  At the moment, these two assemblers are supported:

    as504   -- http://www.vanwal.nl/as504
    ASEM-51 -- http://plit.de/asem-51

  I recommend to compile as504 with this patch to support option "-O":
    http://www.hugovil.com/repository/hvlinux/patches/as504-add-output-file-option.patch
  as504 doesn't come with an installation script so compile and install it with:
    $> make
    $> sudo install as504 /usr/local/bin

  Then reconfigure emu8051 so that as504 can be detected and regression testing
  enabled.
  You can run regression testing by issuing:
    $> make check

  Adding a new test case implies adding a new asm source file inside the tests
  subdirectory and adding its name to two variables in tests/Makefile.am.


This program was tested on the following systems:
  "Linux From Scratch 4.0"
